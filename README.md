Smoothie calorie tracking web app

## Continuing Development with Claude

To continue working on this project in a new Claude conversation, use:

"I have a calorie tracking web app deployed at https://reizen703.github.io/calorie-tracker/ and the code is at https://github.com/reizen703/calorie-tracker. We completed Phase 1 (fruits) and Phase 2 (vegetables). I want to continue developing it by adding [specific feature like recipes/liquids/proteins]."

Current status: Phase 2 complete (fruits + vegetables with custom measurements)
Next planned: Phase 3 options include recipe saving, liquids category, proteins category
